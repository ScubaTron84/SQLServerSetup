From a past DBA role, my attempt at automating as much of the SQL cluster setups as I could. Using Powershell Modules, and leveraging CARBON dll for ad interactions. 
Supports
Server Installation
Cluster Configuration
Mirroring a Database
AlwaysOn Initial Setup

I never finished the Always on automation script, because I changed jobs at the time. 

Also included are a bunch of helpful SQL scripts to standardize the clusters for administration.
